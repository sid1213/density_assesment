## Overview

In Mario, we utilized Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP to construct a web application. Our primary focus during development was on achieving a seamless combination of UI design and functionality.

## Used Technologies

- **[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)** - is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, providing a fast and efficient web application.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and makes it easy to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)** - is a powerful animation library that adds fluid animations and interactivity to enhance the overall user experience.
- **[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)** - Evented I/O for the backend.
- **[AOS (Animate on Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)** - is a JavaScript library that adds stunning animations to web elements as they scroll into view, enhancing the visual appeal of websites
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**- TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability by providing type checking and robust tooling for developers.

And of course _Mario_ itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/sid1213/density_assesment) on GitHub.

## Installation

Mario requires **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** to run server.
